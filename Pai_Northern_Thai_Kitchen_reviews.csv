Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"It's a really busy restaurant but the staff are kind and patient. I came in with a big group and we ended up being late but the staff were very kind to us. I'm genuinely so grateful that they were accommodating and patient with us. The restaurant is nice, and there's a lot of seating. Service is kind and attentive. There was auto gratuity as we were a big group, and they only accept card for payment. I was able to leave an extra cash tip though- I felt so bad that we were late.I ordered the khao soi with curry- you can't adjust spice level for it. It was really good, but I think I prefer the Uptown location more. The beef was a bit tougher compared to the other one. The flavour was great, nice and sweet. It's honestly not too spicy. My boyfriend got the pad see ew, which was also really good. I feel like their food never disappoints. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their food.My meal came out to $28 with auto-gratuity. I left feeling full and happy. Definitely recommend.",Nhu N.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Had a lovely Sunday night dinner at Pai! I was shocked how big it is! My friends and I walked in without a reservation, I discovered that the restaurant is massive - so there were several tables open. The vibe is quite intimate and cozy.Servers were very nice. There were lots of staff on the floor.Food was delicious! I had the red curry with beef. Rice was perfect - not too sweet, but still nice.Would highly recommend!",Celton M.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen offers such a vibrant experience. I loved colorful lighting in the restaurant and the overall vibe at the bar.We didn't have any reservations and the wait was 30 minutes so hung out at the bar which was a great experience. There's a large variety of drinks that were Toronto themed which caught my attention. They had drinks like ""Cherry Trent Jr"" and ""Scotchie Barnes"" which is playful. I chose the Thai Mojito.Now when it came to dinner, the food was my highlight. I ordered the Green Curry Chicken and I must say that this was probably my favorite Green Curry Chicken ever. One thing that made this different than all others is that it's served in a coconut. The dish itself was tasty but one thing that I particularly loved was scraping the coconut and having a dessert-like experience afterward.Overall this place was great. Great location, wonderful ambiance, and enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff. I appreciated that they were able to help my colleague who had a gluten and dairy allergy.",Michael C.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"We arrived on a weekend for dinner around 4:30pm and the place was packed. There was a long line at the door. Luckily, we got a table after 10min wait. Their convenient location near many theatres and venues makes it a popular option in the area.The restaurant is spacious with colourful decoration. The music isn't too loud and the noise level is suitable for conversations.Our server told us their signature dishes are Pad Kra Pao and Khao Soi.Pad Kra Pao: very good and well-seasoned. We ordered it with crispy pork and it was so delicious! Highly recommend ordering crispy pork to go with this dish.Khao Soi: presentation was great, so tasty and comforting.Thai milk tea: good, just the right amount of sweetnessService was very good despite how busy the restaurant was.I'd definitely come back to try other dishes.",Lisa D.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Dude. I think this is the best Thai restaurant Ive eaten outside of Thailand. Not to be dramatic. My family didn't reserve cuz we are clowns, so we waited 1.5 hours but it was well worth the wait.The skewers were incredible - juicy and well grilled. The Moo Ping took me back to Thailand.I got the fish green curry and it was good. The fish was well cooked and fresh. Very well balanced flavors, along with a fun presentation if you care for that.However, the Khao Soi (which is my favorite Thai dish ever) was incredible. Deep and rich with flavor (spicy, yet tangy, and sweet), and great portion size.The dessert was also incredible - we got the coconut ice cream, and it was so fresh. The toppings also added such a variety of texture.",Angela S.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Chicken wings were to die for.. so good, especially with the chilli sauce. Made my nose run because of the heat. Loved it.Khao soi was tasty too. So happy I ordered it.Loved this cute restaurant with friendly and attentive staff.So glad I took the time out to have lunch here during a work day!",Dom G.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Wowowowow! What an experience! From start to finish, Pai is incredible and I'm so sad I won't be able to revisit it until my next trip to Toronto.I was warned by multiple people that I'd have to wait in a long line if I wanted to go to Pai without a reservation. I decided to chance it anyway and dropped in as a single around 4pm on a Saturday and I was excited to find out it would only be a 10-15 minute wait. It ended up being just under 10 minutes.I was seated at the bar at the far end of the deceptively large restaurant. The basement space feels cozy and colourful with lots of decor to look at and a tropical-vibe.I started things off with a Thai mojito which was a brilliant purple colour. It was a refreshing twist on a classic. For dinner I had a vegetarian version of the Khao Soi which is served with tofu, veggies, and noodles (can be made vegan on request by changing out the egg noodles). This was one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. The coconut-based broth was bright, flavourful, and perfectly spiced. It was very filling and I was sad that I couldn't take my leftovers with me.",Laurel B.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Pai Northern Thai Kitchen has got to be one of my favorite spots in Toronto! I was visiting for the weekend and decided to check it out on a Friday, even though we originally planned to go Saturday. It was a quick walk from our hotel, so we figured why not? Even though the place was packed, we got seated right away at a high-top table. Regular table wait time was 30-45 minutes. It's shared with other groups, but there's still plenty of room to feel comfortable and chat with your friends.We ordered a ton of food: Thai chicken wings, the Northern Platter, pad see ew with shrimp, green curry, mango sticky rice, a Thai iced tea, and pineapple juice. There were three of us, we knew we overordered, but everything was so good that we somehow managed to finish it all.The Thai chicken wings were fried with a nice texture, though they weren't super crispy. The sweet sauce drizzled over them was perfect, and I loved that balance of flavors. The Northern Platter was massive and looked almost intimidating--it's definitely shareable and could easily be a meal on its own. It came with sticky rice, pork skewers, northern laab salad, Thai sausages, and these squash fritters. The pork skewers were a highlight; they were so tasty I wanted more. there was a hint of sweetness coated on the pork skewers. The laab salad was really spicy, but even I couldn't stop myself from taking a few bites because it was that good. The Thai sausages had just the right amount of saltiness, and the squash fritters were a fun surprise--I thought they were sweet potato fries at first.The pad see ew with shrimp was delicious and not too oily, which is a huge plus. The only bummer was that there were only three shrimp. I didn't even get to try one. Next time, I'd probably go for the chicken or beef instead.The green curry was amazing. We got it with beef, and it had just the right amount of spice. The beef pieces were a little thick, but overall, the flavors were on point. It was served in a whole coconut, which added this lovely coconut sweetness to the spicy curry. And once we finished, we even scooped out the coconut flesh!Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't skip dessert. We ordered two mango sticky rice, because it's a must-have at any Thai restaurant. The mango was perfectly ripe and sweet, and the sticky rice, still warm, was drizzled with coconut sauce that made it so comforting. Even if you're full, you have to try it--it's worth it!Overall, if you're in Toronto, Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is a must-visit. The food is incredible, the atmosphere is always buzzing, and it's totally worth the trip, whether you're a local or just in town for the weekend.",Christy Y.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Good thai food overall! Really enjoyed the aesthetic inside and love that they have a waiting area + bar for you to wait at! Came at 6, waited for 15min for table for 4, and had a yummy meal! I think they were p rushed bc they took a while for food + forgot some things but not really a big bother. Kind people, great vibes, enjoyed a classic toronto spot overall :DFelt on the same level as Soothr in NYC. Wish there were more noodles in Khao Soi, but the flavors were pretty great.",Ashley C.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"UM what a spot. This was the first food spot I visited when going to Toronto for the first time and I was absolutely not disappointed.I had heard that it can be difficult to walk in and be seated, but we were able to right away. We ordered a variety of appetizer/table sharers before our main meal - all of the apps were great - from vegetable fried rice to wings, etc.My main meal was the pad gra prow which was recommended by the kind waitress. It was delicious and had just the right amount of spice (base level). The crunch that was added from the crispy pork was soo tasty.Definitely understand why this restaurant is acclaimed. The atmosphere was beautiful, calm and relaxing and the food was delicious.This is the type of restaurant that deserves a Michelin Star.",Maurice V.,4

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,We ordered:1. Gaeng Kiaw Wan Green Curry2. Pad Gra Prow3. Khao Soi4. Pad See Ew5. Mango sticky rice6. Coconut sorbetSolid Thai food. Pad See Ew and pad Gra prow wasn't terribly greasy. White rice was kind of mushy and not the best quality. Meats were dry but flavors were great across the dishes. Coconut sorbet was so creamy and perfect for coconut lovers.Waiter was very nice and helpful.,Nolan F.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"I absolutely love this place!!!! 5/5 nothing bad to say.My friend and I came to PAI on a Friday night with no reservation after seeing all their reservations were booked up. We still went to take our chances with walk in around 7pm and we got a table within 15 mins! It was super busy yet they were still able to seat many of us who walked in.The place upon entrance looks small but it is MASSIVE inside. The vibes are so good with the decor and the lighting. We both only wanted a main as we needed to leave pretty quickly. Service was super fast and friendly.Food:- Pad Thai with Beef (no chives): 5/5 stars. I was absolutely starving and this was phenomenal. It was not too sweet or sour. It was perfect. Texture was great and portions were pretty big. I could've taken some home if I wanted to but was too hungry.As we were in a rush, we were able to leave within 45 mins of being there. 5/5!!! Would recommend even if you don't have a reso",Julia L.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Though this is one of the most notoriously difficult restaurants to get a table at in Toronto, the lively ambiance and delicious food make it worth the wait! I tried the Laab Salad with beef, which was very flavourful.I'm looking forward to trying more menu items here in the future!",Yoland E.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"We walked in around 4:30 on a Friday with no reservation and were seated immediately. Definitely go earlier than later because the place filled up while we were there. People were waiting and the bar and there was a line outside the door.Place was cute and our server was wonderful! We got a Thai iced tea and a white sangria that came with an entire lychee in it. Drinks were pretty good.We ordered chicken satay and the squash fritters to start. The satay had good flavor but the squash fritters were out of this world! The batter was light and sweet while the tamarind-based dipping sauce made it refreshing. We had to stop ourselves from eating the entire basket!We also shared a beef salad and a papaya salad. The beef salad was good, but the meat was cut a bit too thick. I love my spicy food so I got ""Thai spicy"" for the papaya salad. It was actually not that spicy. The spice was more of a slow burn that built up over time. The rice noodles were a good addition to soak up the juice on the bottom. They were out of shrimp chips that day so we only got pork rinds, which were also very light. The Pad Thai was just Pad Thai. It was good but nothing special.I was looking forward to their Thai iced tea gelato served in a young coconut, but it was out so we got the sticky rice instead. Again, it was good, nothing special. I would recommend trying their other desserts instead.",Rachel A.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Had an epic meal here last night absolutely loved every single dish I put on the table. We start with a variety of appetizers, including pork and chicken, skewers squash, fritters and they were all amazing. The pork head, a wonderful spicy sweet taste with a little bit of charm from the grill that really made it stand out. Would definitely order that again without hesitation. For entrées, we got pad Thai and pad gra prow. Both of these dishes were absolutely fantastic. Plenty large enough to split with your dining partners. Between the four of us, we had three entrées, eight family style and there's more than enough food. The chicken pant was probably among the best I've ever had great flavor in the sauce and the chicken was nice and tender and delicious.The star of the show was the coconut sorbet. Served a half coconut comes topped with mango shredded coconut and peanuts, and it was absolutely delible one of the best desserts I've had in a long long time. You're doing a great disservice on yelp reviews for this restaurant and you don't end up dying there.On top of the great food, it had a cool funky vibe with the decor the restaurants located in the building and has some community tables and a lot of other quirky seating locations. All the way around.",Brian E.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"October 12/2024: Lupper with my Al & Larry/Mary.This was a very interesting restaurant. It's in the basement of a building but it was busy as all get out for a later afternoon (4:00pm ish). Bench style seating for the tables and a fast seating. Had our table quickly.I had the spring rolls ($14.99) as an appie. They were delicious, crispy & crunchy with a plum dipping sauce.My main was Pad See Ew with Chicken ($23.99). This was my first time trying this and it was delicious as well. Very tasty but I should have added MORE spice.I also tried a fork full of Mango Slaw ($19.50) & it was very good as well. No complaint about this place except for their lack of menu flexibility.It's a do over for me if I'm in the area.",Gary M.,8
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Good Thai food. I bit chaotic for my taste but that is authentic Thai street feel so I can't complain. Staff was good, friendly and attentive. Food came out very social media friendly",Eleanor Elaine C.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"Door dashed the Chicken Pad Thai (Medium) and it was very good. It was very good.I marked the order to include utensils, but it did not. Luckily I had a fork at my hotel so it all worked out.",Matt S.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"My husband suggested this Thai restaurant for dinner and I am glad he did.  When we arrived, there was a line out to give our names for dine in.  I also saw that they were on Open Table, but all the reservations were also gone..so we waited in line and after about 10 min we gave our name.  We were told it would take about 20 min so we headed to the bar and got some drinks.The place is huge..it has several dining rooms and all of them are ample and very nicely laid out.Our server was really sweet and nice. We opened the menu via the QR code and we decided on the Pad Gra Prow for my husband (basil stir fried with beef over rice) and the Pad See Ew for me (thick rice noodles with chicken).  We started the meal with some chicken satay.  Everything was outstanding...the flavors were probably some of the best I've had outside of Thailand.  It was a winning dining experience.Large menu with salads, rices, noodles, soups, etc....please check it out next time you are in the area....well worth it....",Robert S.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3788,"The vibe at Pai Northern Thai Kitchen was laid back despite it being a Michelin rated restaurant. Hence the hubs said we had to go.The gaeng hunglay or oxtail curry was really interesting. The rice was adorably wrapped in leaves. You don't often see such a dish at Thai places. But then I've recently learned that northern Thai cuisine is slightly different. The curry had a sweet and sour taste with notes of garlic and ginger. It was flavorful but not overwhelming like sweet and sour soup for instance. All this was set to a mild spice level.The chicken pad see ew was delicious. This is one of my all time favorite dishes to get. There was a perfect portion of chicken, veggies, and noodles. But the most important thing was the abundant noodles! The veggie stems in this dish was rather bitter, and I couldn't pinpoint what type it was. The chunkiness allowed you to taste the bitterness which slightly turned me off. It turned out that it was Chinese broccoli. Ha! [Yeah. I don't read the full menu to remember.]Here's a link to their menu:https://paitoronto.com/menu/pai-menu#section5The experience is right around 3 or 4 stars for me. Service was on point despite people whizzing about. The decor and atmosphere was fun and chill. Overall it was good food but at a pricey price point.Was it worth it? To try a Michelin rated restaurant once, yes. To come back and dine again? Probably not for the inflated price due to its hyped up reputation. That's my take on this anyway...",Andrea M.,4
